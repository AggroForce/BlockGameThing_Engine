These notes are to plan out what we are going to do for all aspects

Physics
IMPORTANT
- Fix and tidy up collisions
- Make worlds save to a file
- Develop a data format so that worlds do not take up massive space

DATA FORMAT CONSIDERATIONS
- Fast loading for dynamic objects for pseudo segment-loading
- Compress blocks of similar materials into bounding volumes for better storage
- Data structure should be expandable
- Should be able to reference a segment from another file quickly



FUTURE CONSIDERATION
- Base Game Mechanics
- Enemy Design
- AI Design
- Production Mechanics
- Enconomy Mechanics
- Economy Simulation
- Liquid Dynamics
- Fluid Simulation (Encompasses Gasses and Liquids)
